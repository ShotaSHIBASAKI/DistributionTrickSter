# DistributionTrickSter
Data and codes of Shibasaki et al (xxx) analyzing the distributions of trickster animals and real animals.


## TrickSter_data3.csv
This files contain the GPS data, categories of animals, climate data, correspinding hex grids, 
whether correpsonding real animals exist or not in the grids, and the normalized climate data of each tricksters.
Some data missing the climate data, if, for example,  the GPS points at small islands.

## Real_annimal_hex_biome.csv
This files summarize the hex grids where atleast one corresponding real animals is observed and average climate data in each grid. 
The first two columns show from which GPS data we obtained the hex grids.

## gbif file
Need to be summarize and remove JP

## Biome_distributions.csv
This file summarize hex grid and their climate data where either real animals (RA) of trickster animals (TS) exist. The category of the animals is also showmn.

## AnalysisNote6.pdf
This file provides the codes and maps that show distributions of real and trickster animals over the world.

## AnalysisNote8.pdf
This file vizualizes the results of permutation tests where we tested whether the trickster animals randomly exist on places that corresponding real animals were observedor trickster animals were clogged.
